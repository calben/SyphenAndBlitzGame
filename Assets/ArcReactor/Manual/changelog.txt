1.5
 - added playback messages
 - added Clamp playback type
 - added Size Multiplier variable which allows scaling ray system as a whole
 - changed left-over particles system behaviour(fixed null reference errors, better perfromance)
 - changed particles emission mechanism (more stability in emissions, randomization support)
 - fixed interframe interpolation for emission shape (no more rogue particles at the start of the system)
 - added new ready-to-use ray prefabs - fire ray, ice ray, oscillating plasma ray
 
 

1.4b
 - fixed Touched object messaging when combined with physical propagation
 - fixed shape transforms check at startup (now includes shape points)

1.4
 - added physical ray propagation (ArcReactor_Launcher)
 - added Touched object messaging (ArcReactor_Launcher)
 - added Shape curves settings (ArcReactor_Arc)
 - Complex nesting - now you can nest arc to 2 other arc with mix coefficient (ArcReactor_Arc)
 - Shape texture option added (ArcReactor_Arc)
